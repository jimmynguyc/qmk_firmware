These configuration files are specifically for the Keyboardio Atreus, a

[Keyboardio](https://github.com/keyboardio). The keyboard is currently on
Kickstarter, and will come fully assembled.

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make keyboardio/atreus:default:avrdude

*Unlike the TMK firmware, these commands should be run from the root of the repository, not the directory containing this readme.*
